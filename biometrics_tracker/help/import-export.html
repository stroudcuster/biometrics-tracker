<h2>Importing Data</h2>
<p>
If you've been using a spreadsheet to keep track of your readings, they can probably be imported into the
Biometrics Tracker application.  This requires that the spreadsheet have columns for the date, time (optional) and
the values for each type of reading in it's own column.  You can create a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file
from your spreadsheet application by selecting the "Save As" menu option and selecting the CSV format, or by
selecting an "Export" function that allows you to create a CSV file.  If you have column headings, those can
be included in the file.  Some CSV conversions ask if you want to enclose string (alpha character) values in quotes.
The Biometric Tracker's import function will handle quoted of unquoted strings.  If your data includes, commas however,
select the option to quote strings if it is available.
</p>
<p>
Once you have created the CSV file and you know its location in your directory structure, select the <span class="menu-item">Import from
CSV</span> option from the <span class="menu-item">Import/Export</span> menu.  If you are tracking information for more than one person, you will
be presented with the <span class="widget-label">Person Selection List</span> mentioned previously.  After you select the person associated
with the data to be imported, you will be presented with a <a href="glossary.html#glossary-gui" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">GUI</a> similar to the 
one shown below.  As with other application functions, if you are only tracking one person, this <a href="glossary.html#glossary-gui" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">GUI</a> will be presented immediately after you
make the menu selection.  It allows you to select the file to be imported and inform the import function
about the format of the file.  If you click the <span class="widget-label">Browse</span> button to the right of the 
file name <a href="glossary.html#glossary-entry-field" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">entry field</a>, a file selection <a href="glossary.html#glossary-dialog" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">dialog</a> will be presented.  Select the file to be imported.
</p>

<p>
The first thirty lines of the file will be displayed in the pane in the lower portion of the GUI.  Next there are
three things you have to know about the format of the CSV file.  Examining the displayed file will help you answer
these questions.
</p>
<img src="images/import-csv-2.png" width="986" height="766" alt="" class="screenshot">
<ol>
<li>
How many lines of column heading are at the start of the file?  These are referred to as header lines. Enter
this number to the prompt.  In the GUI image above, there are 3 header lines at the top of the displayed file.
If there are no column heading lines, enter 0.</li>
<li>
You may have formatted your spreadsheet so that, in a series of readings for a given day, the date only appears in
the first row associated with the day.  See the spreadsheet image below for an example of this format.  If
you did this, click the <a href="glossary.html#glossary-checkbox" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">check box</a> labeled 
<span class="widget-label">Use date from previous column if date column is blank</span>.</li>
<li>
What data appears in each column.  In a CSV file, each column's data is separated from the others by commas.
Examine the displayed file or you original spreadsheet.  Use the <a href="glossary.html#glossary-combobox" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">combo box</a>
 fields to select the type of data associated with each column.  If you want to ignore the contents of the column, pick the 
 <span class="widget-label">Ignore</span> selection in the combo box associated with that column.  The number to the left of each combo box indicates 
 the column it is referring to.  Note that the sequence of numbers proceeds horizontally, not vertically.  Be careful to make sure you have all
of the appropriate selections made, as they will determine how your data is imported into the application's database.
Once you have all of your selections made, click the <span class="widget-label">Proceed</span> button.  If you decide not the continue with the
import process, click the <span class="widget-label">Cancel</span> button to exit the GUI.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The <span class="widget-label">Select</span> and <span class="widget-label">Save</span> buttons located in the lower right area of the window allow
you save save and reuse the choices you have made regarding the format of your import file.  This is useful if you will be doing imports periodically; 
you won't have to scratch you head to remember what selections you made previously.  The set of selections you make are referred to as an Import Specification.  
Each Specification is identified by an ID that you assign.  Clicking the <span class="widget-label">Save</span> button will display a pop-up dialog showing you
a list of Specification IDs you have assigned in the past and prompting you to enter an ID for the new Specification.  Note that you must click the
<span class="widget-label">Save</span> button before you click the <span class="widget-label">Proceed</span> button.
</p>
<img src="images/import-csv-6.png" width="454" height="332" alt="" class="small-screenshot">
<p>When you want to re-use a specification, click the <span class="widget-label">Select</span> button.  You will be presented with a 
<a href="glossary.html#glossary-dialog" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">dialog</a> showing you a list of ID's of saved Import Specifications.  
Double click on the id of the specification you want to use.
<p>

<p>The <a href="glossary.html#glossary-entry-field" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">entry fields</a> on the GUI will be filled with the values contained in the Import Specification you selected
</p>
<p>
When the import process is complete, a GUI similar to the one shown below will be presented.  Any issued that occurred
in the importation process will be noted, along with the number of CSV file rows processed and application database
rows produced.  It's a good idea to produce a <span class="menu-item">History Report</span> so that you can examine the results 
of the import process in detail.

<h2>Exporting Data</h2>
<p>
The information you enter into the Biometrics Tracker database belongs to you.  That means you should be able to move it to other applications.  The Biometrics 
Tracker application can export data to two formats; a Comma Separated File (CSV) or to the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html" target="_blank">SQLite3</a> relational database format.  I chose to implement these 
formats because they are widely used.  You can import the CSV file into a spreadsheet application and the SQLite3 database is open source, it is very widely used 
and has been around for twenty years.  Most mobile applications that store data directly on the mobile device use this database.
</p>
<p>
To access the Export function, select the <span class="menu-item">Export to CSV/SQL</span> option from the <span class="menu-item">Import/Export</span> menu
A <a href="glossary.html#glossary-gui" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">GUI</a> similar to the one show below will be displayed.
</p>
<img src="images/export-1.png" width="980" height="766" alt="" class="screenshot">
<p>
The first step is to select a folder where the export file will be placed by entering the folder path into the first 
<a href="glossary.html#glossary-entry-field" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">entry field</a> on the GUI.
It is important to note the difference between this prompt and a similar one on the <span class="menu=item">Import From CSV</span> window.  There, you
were prompted to select a file to be imported... here you are being prompted for a folder where the export file will be placed.  An example of
the selection dialog is shown below:
</p>
<img src="images/export-2.png" width="980" height="764" alt="" class="screenshot">
<p>
There are quite a few options presented on this window.  If you are creating an export file to be used to import data into another non-spreadsheet application,
make sure that you have a detailed specification of the formatting requirements for the file.  If you wish to load it into a spreadsheet for your own use, 
you can be more flexible.  Before proceeding with the creation of the file, you must be able to answer these questions.
</p>
<ol>
<li>What date range of data to you want to include in the export file.  Note the <span class="widget-label">Start Date</span> and 
<span class="widget-label">End Date</span> prompts on the window shown below</li>
<li>What file format do you want to use, CSV or SQL. Note the <span class="widget-label">Export File Type</span> combo box on the window shown below</li>
<li>Do you want to include a header row.  This applies to CSV files only.  Note the <span class="widget-label">Include Header Row?</span> check box on
the window shown below</li>
<li>How will the unit of measure (<a href="glossary.html#glossary-uom" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">UOM</a>) associated with each metric be handled? 
 There are three options: it can be appended to the <a href="glossary.html#glossary-metric" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">metric</a> value, it can be
shown in a separate column, or it can be excluded completely. Appending the UOM give a nice appearance, but it may mean that the value cannot be treated
as a number in the destination application.  If that is a problem, you can chose to each UOM in it's own column, immediately after the value, or you can
omit it completely.  Note the <span class="widget-label">Units of Measure will be:</span> <a href="glossary.html#glossary-combobox" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">combo box</a>
 on the GUI shown below</li>
<li>How will dates and times be formatted: what order should the day, month and year be in, and what character will separate them.
<li>Which format will you be using for time: 12 or 24 hour.  If you chose a </span>year/month/day date format and a 24 hour time format, the resulting
data may be easier to sort in a spreadsheet application.  See the <span class="widget-label">Date Format</span> and <span class="widget-label">Time Format</span>
combo boxes on the window shown below</li>
<li>What information will be included in the export.  This selection is very similar to the field selection options on the 
<span class="menu-item">Import from CSV</span> window.  See the field selection combo boxes on the GUI shown below.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Export function offers the same ability to save and select Specifications as the Import function.  If you export data on a periodic basis, this
feature can save you some head scratching. When you are satisfied with your selections, click the <span class="widget-label">Proceed</span> button.  
If you do not want to continue with the export process, click the <span class="widget-label">Cancel</span> button.</p>
<img src="images/export-3.png" width="976" height="763" alt="" class="screenshot">
<p>
When the export file creation is complete, a message similar to the one shown below will be displayed.  Note the export file pathname.  You will need to
know this to import the information into another application.
