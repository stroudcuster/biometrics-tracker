The <span class="menu-item">Start Scheduler/Dispatcher</span> function examines the schedules entered for each person tracked by the application and submits one or more time-triggered 
tasks to start entry sessions for each schedule approaching a trigger point, then starts a Dispatcher job that will run in the background, monitoring the 
scheduled entry sessions and initiating those whose scheduled time has arrived.  The Dispatcher job will end when there are no more entry sessions scheduled,
or when you turn off your computer. Stopping the Dispatcher should not normally be necessary, as it is only consumes a small amount of your system's resources.
 You can also stop the Dispatcher job by selecting this menu selection and clicking the <span class="widget-label">Stop Dispatcher</span>
button that is displayed when the Dispatcher job is running.  You can get a preview of the events to be scheduled by using the 
<span class="menu-item">View Upcoming Events</span> function.  Selecting the <span class="menu-item">Start Scheduler</span> menu option will display the
<a href="glossary.html#glossary-gui" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">GUI</a> shown below:

<p>Click the <span class="widget-label">Start Scheduler and Dispatcher</span> button to start the Scheduler process.  After a short time, a list of events schedules will be displayed
on the lower portion of the GUI as shown below.

<p>As mentioned above, after <a href="glossary.html#glossary-entry-session" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">entry session</a> tasks have been submitted, a background process is initiated to monitor the tasks and initiate each one when
its appointed time comes.  If you wish to stop this background process, click the <span class="widget-label">Stop</span> button.

Because most of what the Start Scheduler process does is unseen, it posts its actions to log file. This file is created in the biometrics-tracker/logs folder
located in your home folder.  An example log file is shown below.
