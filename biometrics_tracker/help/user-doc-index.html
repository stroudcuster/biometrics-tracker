<h2>Initial Configuration</h2>
<p>The first time you start the Biometrics Tracker application, you will be presented with the display shown below:</p>
<img src="images/config-display.png" width="502" height="234" alt="Configuration Window" class="small-screenshot" caption="The Configuration Window"></img>
<p> 
You will be asked to specify the font size you would like to use for the application windows.  A smaller font allows the display of more information, 
a larger font is easier to read.  When you click the ‘Create Config’ button the database file and configuration file will be created.  A folder named 
"biometrics-tracker" will be created in you home folder.  Within this folder, these folders will be created:
<dl>
<dt>data</dt>
<dd>the SQLite3 database file will be located in this folder</dd>
<dt>config</dt>
<dd>configuration information for the Biometrics Tracker application will be located in this folder</dd>
<dt>logs</dt>
<dd>log files created by the Biometrics Tracker Schedule function will be located in this folder</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<section id="application-window">
<h2>The Application Window</h2>
<p>After the initial configuration is completed, and subsequent times that you start the application, you will be presented with the display shown below.  The top bar
has several drop down menus that are organized in the following fashion.</p>
<ul class="menu" id="menu-overview">

<h2>Check Boxes and Radio Buttons</h2>
<p>In addition to <a href="#glossary-field" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">entry fields</a> that allow you to enter text or numbers, the Biometrics Tracker uses 
<a href="#glossary-checkbox" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">check boxes</a> and <a href="#glossary-radio-button" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">radio buttons</a>. You indicate
your choice by clicking on the box with the left mouse button or by pressing on the space bar when the check box is in focus.  Using the space bar allows you to keep your hands on the key board,
 which makes for faster an more accurate data entry.  The image below shows an unselected check box in focus.  The fact that it is unchecked is indicated by the 
 gray color.
</p>
<img src="images/unchecked-box-in-focus.png" width: 695px; height: 137px; class="small-screenshot"/>
<p>The image below shows a selected <a href="#glossary-checkbox" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">check box</a>
<a href="#glossary-in-focus" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">in focus</a>. The fact that it is checked is indicated by the blue color.
</p>
<img src="images/checked-box-in-focus.png" width: 630px; height: 136px; class="small-screenshot"/>
<p>The image below shows a selected <a href="#glossary-checkbox" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">check box</a> out of focus.
</p>
<img src="images/checked-box-out-of-focus.png" class="small-screenshot"/>
<p>A set of <a href="#glossary-radio-button" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">radio buttons</a> that allow you to select a single choice from a set of options.  A radio button is selected by click is with the left mouse button or pressing
the space bar when the button is <a href="#glossary-in-focus" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">in focus</a>.  The term 'radio button' refers to the station selection buttons on radios in cars of years gone by; pressing one 
button unset all the others. The image below shows a set of radio buttons, the selected button (AM) in focus and the unselected
button out of focus.

<section id="combo-boxes">
<h2>Combo Boxes</h2>
<p>A combo box is another GUI element that prompts you to select from a list of choices.  Initially, it looks similar to a regular entry field, except for
a small arrow in the lower right hand corner. See the image on the left below.  When you click on the combo box, a pop-down list is displayed.  See the
image in the center below.  Depending on the number of possible values, not all of the choices are initially displayed.  If this is the case, you can scroll though the list of values. To select a
value, click on it.  The value will appear in the entry field.  See the image on the right below.

<section id="entering-dates-and-times">
<h3>Entering Dates and Times</h3>
<p>The date and time entry fields used by the Biometric Tracker have been designed to facilitate fast and accurate entry.  The month, day, hour and minute 
<a href="#glossary-field" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">fields<a> are checked to assure that they fall within the valid range of values.  
If an invalid value is entered, the <a href="#glossary-field" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">field</a> will be cleared and surrounded by a red border, as
shown below.
</p>
<img src="images/invalid-hour-error.png" class="small-screenshot"/>
<p>  When a date or time field is <a href="#glossary-in-focus" target="_blank" class="glossary-link">in focus</a>, pressing the up or down arrows will increment or decrement the value.  
You can use either the arrows at the bottom right of the main keyboard or the arrow on the numeric pad, if the NumLock key is not in effect.  If you are entering 
data points that have accumulated over a period of time, this helps to speed the entry process.
 </p>

<section id="entering-numeric-data">
<h3>Entering Numeric Data</h3>
<p>When entering numeric data, be aware that blanks are not taken as a zero value.  If you enter blanks to a numeric <a href="#glossary-field" target="_blank"
class="glossary-link">field</a>, it will be bordered in red as shown below.</p>
